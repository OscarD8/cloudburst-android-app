# Cloudburst — MyCity App  

**Cloudburst** is a concept city information Android app. Inspired by solarpunk aesthetics, this app showcases Cloudburst’s restaurants, cafés, parks, temples, and mycelium printers through an adaptive layout designed in **Figma** and implemented with **Jetpack Compose**.
